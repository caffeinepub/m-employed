  "summary": "REQ-24 and REQ-25 appear implemented (new React Query hook with stable key and Employer Dashboard stats card with loading skeleton and safe fallback). REQ-23 is only partially met because the new backend member-count query is not authorized (it is explicitly implemented as requiring no authorization). The diff also introduces unrelated “About” pages/routes/nav changes that were not requested.",

      "reason": "The new method is implemented as a public query with no caller context or permission checks, and is commented as requiring no authorization.",
