## Summary
**Goal:** Update user-facing branding text and the browser tab title to use “M Employed” instead of “Caffeine Jobs” and the current generic title.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all user-facing frontend text occurrences of “Caffeine Jobs” with “M Employed”, including the Landing page CTA sentence.
- Update `frontend/index.html` page `<title>` to include “M Employed” instead of “Employer–Employee Connection Website (Job Marketplace)”.

**User-visible outcome:** The UI and browser tab consistently display “M Employed” as the product/brand name, and the Landing page CTA no longer mentions “Caffeine Jobs”.
